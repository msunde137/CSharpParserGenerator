## Examples

We recommend reviewing some of the examples available
    
* [Math Expression](./Examples/MathExpression) is a console project with the minimum settings for working with **CSharpParserGenerator**.
* [Dynamic Query](./Examples/DynamicQuery) is a sample of how to work with **CSharpParserGenerator** in real use with .Net Core; integrated with features of Entity Framework, Http Requests, Databases, and Linq expressions. The idea of this example is to implement a custom language for querying.
